# SPACE HELL
Space Hell is a top-down space themed shooter and bullet hell game coded in Java [Processing](https://processing.org/).
# Installation
You can download this game from the [Releases](https://github.com/Sprinter05/spacehell/releases/latest) page and downloading the compressed file corresponding to your OS. It already comes compiled and with Java bundled except for the Linux version for which you will need [OpenJDK 17](https://adoptium.net/).
## Compiling the game
You are still free to compile the game yourself by downloading the source code and exporting it as a program using the [Processing App](https://processing.org/download).
# How to play the game
As I previously said this is a top-down bullet hell shooter. The original 1.0 release only has one boss so your main goal is to defeat it. Move with the **directional arrows** and press **Z** to shoot and **X** to focus (focus will reduce your speed for better movement between bullets). You can pause and resume the game using **Space**. The game also includes a Debug option to show collisions that can be toggled with the **T** key.
## Other things to know
The green balls that appear will recover your HP when destroyed and the logs that appear next to the boss in his last phase are shields that must be destroyed to be able to attack the boss again.
# Game's origins
This game was made for a final coding project for our high school based in another very Touhou inspired Scratch game I originally made with the help of a friend. It was made from scratch in around 2 weeks by me and 3 other classmates.
## Task distribution
Code was mostly made by me (**Sprinter05**) with the UI and some other parts coded by **josedanielvv**. All the art was made using [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/) by **NotAnisito**. Finally, **Adrianroca** was in charge of the presentation (not available here).
# FAQ
## Will the game be updated in the future?
Maybe, I don't know, if I update the game it will probably be to add some small features or for bug fixing reasons but I'm unsure if we will make a full new version with big additions.
## Why is there no sound at all?
If you check previous commits you will notice that the game was originally going to have SFX but due to the available Processing sound engines working in very weird manners leading to the game making weird sounds we decided to completely remove sound. If we are able to find a working sound engine we might add them again.
## How do I reset the game?
Unfortunately we didn't include any reset button so you are gonna need to open and close the game to reset it, sorry about that.
